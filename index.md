Section A09, Biwei Huang and Jelena Bradic
1. **Using PC and FCI Causal Discovery Algorithms was the most interesting thing this quarter**
2. **Combining Causal Inference and Reinforcement learning in some way**
3. **I wish we could have done something a bit more related to clickthrough information or advertisement information but the data is not readily available**
4. **I would be interested in using Inference somewhere in the project of Q1 still, and probably how it could be used to improve neural networks**
